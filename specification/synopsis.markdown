# SMMART Specification

This document describes the entire SMMART Specification. It has three parts:

  - Core SMMART Schema, which defines a set of JSON Schemata used by other parts
    of SMMART Specification.
  - RESTful API Definition, which defines a set of HTTP endpoints that a
    SMMART-compliant service provider MUST implement.
  - Flat-File SMMART Data Representation, which defines a way to store SMMART-
    compliant data in a plain, static file system structure.

All occurrences of keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
specification are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][rfc-2119].
