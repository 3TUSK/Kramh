# Schema for Minecraft Mod Artifact Resource Tracking (SMMART)

A set of specifications designed for tracking Modded Minecraft related resources,
mostly mod artifacts.

Objectives of this project are:
  - Creating a easy-to-use, intuitive format for describing mod
  - Tracking version history of mod release
  - Making large-scale mod catalog possible
  - Providing an independent model of describing a modpack

On the contrary, these are not objectives of this project:
  - Becoming a mirror on itself, or being a CurseForge replacement
  - Making yet another Minecraft launcher for Modded Minecraft players
  - Providing hosting services
